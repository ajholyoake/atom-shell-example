Atom-shell-example
==================

An example of how to use atom-shell (mainly for Ed)

Install
-------
Might require a 
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g bower

until I work out how to put this into the Gruntfile

Then
1) npm install (from within app directory)
2) bower install (from within app directory)
3) grunt fetchbinary

etc etc
